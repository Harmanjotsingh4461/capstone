StoreBuilder â€“ Online Store Platform
StoreBuilder is a web-based capstone project developed as part of INFO2300 â€“ Winter 2024. This application empowers usersâ€”particularly entrepreneursâ€”to easily create and manage their own online stores. It includes core features such as store creation, product management, customer interaction via chat, user reviews, and profile management.

This project was designed to demonstrate full integration between a modern React frontend and Firebase services, implementing version control, continuous integration concepts, and a user-friendly experience.
